# Project Title
Profile Card App

## Project Description
This project is the official submission for the Mobile Programming - React Native Lab 1 assignment. The primary objective of this lab was to build a "Profile Card" application. This application demonstrates the implementation of fundamental React Native concepts, including: creating reusable components (ProfileCard), styling with the StyleSheet API, laying out elements using Flexbox , rendering scrollable lists with <ScrollView> , and handling user input (TouchableOpacity) to provide feedback (Alert).

The profile data has been customized to feature prominent Turkish figures: poet Cahit Zarifoğlu and scientists Cahit Arf and Aziz Sancar.
